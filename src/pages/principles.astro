                    <h2>Be Professional</h2>
                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Professionalism extends beyond our paying career - it
                        defines how we approach every aspect of life. True
                        professionalism means bringing high levels of engagement
                        and focus to any task, while maintaining objectivity and
                        avoiding personal or emotional interference. It's about
                        consistently delivering the results that others depend
                        on you to achieve.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The essence of professionalism is the focus upon the
                        work and its demands, while we are doing it, to the
                        exclusion of all else." - Brendan Francis

                    <h2>Be Decisive</h2>
                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Analysis is important, but action is essential.
                        Indecision is simply deciding to let the world decide
                        for you.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Truly successful decision-making relies on a balance
                        between deliberate and instinctive thinking." - Malcolm

                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Each of us is a person and deserves to be treated with
                        courtesy, regardless of their background, beliefs, or
                        opinions.

                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Confidence without humility is arrogance. Every person
                        you meet knows something you don't, approach each
                        interaction as a chance to learn.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's
                        thinking of yourself less." - Rick Warren

                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Take ownership of your actions, decisions, and their
                        consequences. When things go right, share the credit.
                        When things go wrong, own it and fix it.

                    <blockquote>
                        "You must take personal responsibility. You cannot
                        change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but
                        you can change yourself." - Jim Rohn

                        These aren't just words on the internet, they are the
                        constellation that guides me. I often fall short or
                        stray from the path, but the pursuit of these ideals
                        shapes how I work and the challenges I seek.
